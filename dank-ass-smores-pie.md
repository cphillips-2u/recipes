# DANK ASS SMORES PIE

you know you want some dank smores pie.....

##  Ingredients
* 6-8 ounces semi sweet chocolate, chopped (PROTIP: works with mix of milk and dark)
* ½ cup butter, cut up 
* Pinch salt 
* 1 cup sugar
* 1 tablespoon cocoa, sifted 
* 3 eggs 
* ⅔ cup heavy cream 
* 1 teaspoon vanilla 
* Graham Cracker Crust (homemade or store bought is fine)

## Pre-HEATIN'
* Preheat oven to 350

## DO THE DAMN THING

* Melt chocolate, then incorporate butter until melted
* In a bowl, whisk salt, sugar, cocoa, eggs and heavy cream and vanilla.
* Once combined blend in the chocolate butter mix, let stand and tap the bowl to remove bubbles
* Pour into graham cracker crust

## HEAT THAT SHIT UP

* Place in oven, cook 20-30 minutes up to 45 minutes. 
* The pie should rise (PROTIP: it will sink a lot after coming out of the oven.) 
  * The goal is to make sure the center solidifies, the edges will have a touch of chew to them that people seem to enjoy. 
* At 20 minutes open oven and jiggle the pan. If there is a lot of jiggle, repeat check every 5 minutes. 
  * The pie should shake but be firm, in the middle. If it looks like a jello mold its still not done.
  * It may take 40-45 minutes. 

## COOL THAT SHIT DOWN and BURN YOU SOME MALLOWS
* Let pie cool, spread marshmallows over the top, place under broiler. 
  * EPIC PROTIP: WATCH IT THE ENTIRE TIME, it goes from brown to charcoal in seconds. 

## EAT THAT SHIT
